# Twine/Sugarcube Shop with <q>dynamic</q> inventory

A simple shop inventory system for Twine/Sugarcube, including basic css grid styling.

The goal was to make a shop user experience that was not just a list with a [buy] link and instead generate a shop with images and a buy button.

You'll need to have Tweego installed and added to the *enviroment path* so if you print <code>tweego -v</code> in your shell it should say wich version you have installed.

example:

    tweego -v

Would result in this **if** you are on a *Windows(64)* machine and had version *2.1.1* of tweego installed.
