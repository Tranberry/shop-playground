# Folder and File Structure for Tweego Projects (SugarCube/Twine)

You'll need to have Tweego installed and added to the *enviroment path* so if you print <code>tweego -v</code> in your shell it should say wich version you have installed.

example:

    tweego -v

Would result in this **if** you are on a *Windows(64)* machine and had version *2.1.1* of tweego installed.

    tweego, version 2.1.1+81d1d71 (2020-02-25T07:09:26Z) [windows/amd64]
